# Prime Factors

## Introduction 

The prime factors kata is a math-based kata in which we write a method which will break 
down any number into a list of its prime factors. This means that we return the set of one or 
more prime numbers that when multiplied together will give us the initial number. 

## Requirements 

Write a class named "PrimeFactors" that has one static method: generate. 
- The generate method takes an integer argument and returns a collection of integers. That 

list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence. 

Examples 

```bash
generate(2) = [2] 

generate(3) = [3] 

generate(4) = [2,2] 

generate(6) = [2,3] 

generate(8) = [2,2,2] 

generate(9) = [3,3] 

generate(10)=[2,5] 

generate(12) = [2,2,3]
```
