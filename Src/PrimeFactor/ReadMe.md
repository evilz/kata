# Introduction 

The prime factors kata is a math-based kata in which we write a method which will break down any number into a list of its prime factors. This means that we return the set of one or more prime numbers that when multiplied together will give us the initial number. 
## Requirements 

Write a class named `PrimeFactors` that has one static method: generate. 
The generate method takes an integer argument and returns a collection of integers. That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence. 

__Examples__ 

- generate(2) = [2] 
- generate(3) = [3] 
- generate(4) = [2,2] 
- generate(6) = [2,3] 
- generate(8) = [2,2,2] 
- generate(9) = [3,3] 
- generate(10)=[2,5] 
- generate(12) = [2,2,3]
