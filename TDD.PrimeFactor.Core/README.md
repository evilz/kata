# Introduction 
The prime factors kata is a math-based kata in which we write a method which will break down any number into a list of its prime factors. 
This means that we return the set of one or more prime numbers that when multiplied together will give us the initial number. 

## Requirements 
Write a class named `PrimeFactorizer` that has one static method: Factorize. 
The Factorize method takes an integer argument and returns a collection of integers. That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence. 

##Examples
- Factorize(2) = [2] 
- Factorize(3) = [3] 
- Factorize(4) = [2, 2] 
- Factorize(6) = [2, 3] 
- Factorize(8) = [2, 2, 2] 
- Factorize(9) = [3, 3] 
- Factorize(10) = [2, 5] 
- Factorize(12) = [2, 2, 3]
